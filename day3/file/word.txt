EDWARD LANE, an English orientalist, published a classic account of Egyptian society in the 1830s. Impressed with much else, he had this to say about religion in Egypt: “It is considered the highest honour among the Muslims to be religious; but the desire to appear so leads many into hypocrisy and pharisaical ostentation.”

来自英国的爱德华•雷恩是个东方通，他在19世纪30年代发表了详述埃及社会的作品，堪称经典。他对埃及社会诸多事物都感触颇深，但对其宗教，雷恩却作出 如下言论：“在伊斯兰世界中，虔诚便是最高荣誉。然而，越是想要表现得虔诚，就有越多的人走入虚伪夸饰的误区。”

The same observation might be made today. A generation ago it was rare to hear the Koran recited, except on formal occasions such as funerals or during the fasting month of Ramadan. Nowadays the word of God is a constant companion, wafting from taxi cabs and buses, barber’s shops and fast-food outlets, dental clinics and supermarkets. The call to prayer not only sounds five times daily from minarets but all the time from everywhere: millions of Egyptians have downloaded it as a ringtone for their mobile phones. Step into many shops at noon and you will be told to return after prayers. Call in to the main control room of Egyptian State Railways and you may find the chief operator similarly disengaged, as one panicked signalman did last year when a train stalled on the tracks. He was unable to prevent the next train from crashing into the first, killing 18 people and prompting the resignation of Egypt’s transport minister.

现在，对于埃及的宗教，人们或许会得出相同的结论。30年前，除了葬礼或是斋月这类的正式场合，很少会听到有人诵读古兰经。而今，上帝的圣言却常伴左右： 从出租车公交车里，从理发店快餐店内，从牙科诊所超级市场中，飘忽而出。曾经每天5次从宣礼塔中传出的唤礼辞如今时时刻刻响在大街小巷：因为有成千上百万 的埃及人把唤礼辞当成手机铃声。赶着中午踏进商店，你会被要求在祷告结束后再来；造访埃及国家铁路的主控室，你会发现主控员也如此不务正业。这和去年那个 面对半路“抛锚”的火车而惊慌失措的信号工有的一比。当时，那个信号工没能及时通知随后的一辆火车，导致辆车相撞，18人死亡，埃及运输部长即刻辞职。

Tune to one of 400 Arabic-language channels carried by Nilesat, a satellite owned by the Egyptian government, and the chances are you will come across a bearded sheikh, such as one who recently berated youths for knowing the names of more football players than of the prophet Muhammad’s companions. Millions of Egyptians thrilled by the World Cup clearly ignore such advice. But plenty observe it in spirit: a sample of 10-29-year-olds questioned in a national survey claimed they spent an average of 40 minutes on religious devotions every day. That makes 243 hours a year, or more than a full year in an average lifetime. And that leaves out other devotions, such as fasting in Ramadan, or the pilgrimages to Mecca which draw nearly 700,000 Egyptians a year.

将调频在埃及卫星公司（埃及国有）400多个阿拉伯语频道中转换，总是会碰到蓄着胡子的酋长，和那个最近谴责年轻人们知道更多的足球明星却叫不出几个穆罕 默德先知名字的人一个样。上百万的埃及人为世界杯疯狂着，他们明显将这条教诲置之不理了。但许多人从本质上看待它：一次全国调查显示10到29岁人群每天 献给宗教的时间平均为40分钟。一年就是243个小时，一生就是365天以上。而这其中还不包括其他时间，比如斋月的斋戒，或者每年吸引近70万埃及人的 朝圣。

What goes for Islam also goes for the Coptic Orthodox church, whose 7m or so Egyptian adherents make up the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Its services are packed and the number of novices in dozens of Coptic monasteries is at record levels. Well-funded by rich patrons, the Coptic church remains extremely conservative. Pope Shenouda III, its patriarch since 1971, makes the Catholic one look like Dr Phil, a TV psychologist. Not content to ban divorce, his church will not condone a second marriage for anyone who might actually have managed to get out of the first one.

同样的，科普特正教也遭遇和伊斯兰教相同的境况。埃及的科普特正教信徒有大约七百万，是中东最大的基督教团体，其礼拜仪式举不胜举，几十家科普特修道院的 新信徒数量也令人咂舌。科普特正教的资助人财力雄厚，资金充足，季度保守。教皇施诺达三世1971年成为科普特主教后，使得天主教教皇就像是常出现在电视 里的那个知心叔叔菲尔博士。光是禁止离婚还不够，科普特教会还认为确实解除了前次婚姻而再婚的人是不可原谅的。

Turning to higher things

变本加厉

The current generation of Egyptians is living through a full-scale religious revival. Scholars ascribe the trend to many causes. Some say the shock of defeat in the 1967 war prompted a return to older traditions. Others speculate that rapid population growth and rural migration overwhelmed the secular-minded urban elite of the 1960s. Yet others point to the return of Egyptian workers from rich Arab Gulf countries, having acquired their conservative mores. And there is the influence of world events, with the never-ending plight of the Palestinians, plus Western incursions into other Muslim lands, serving to reinforce attachment to a faith that is seen as under threat.

埃及如今这代人正在经历一场翻天覆地的宗教复兴。学者对这种趋势的原因众说纷纭。有的人认为是1967年中东战争时的全线溃败使埃及人们回归古老的传统； 有的人猜测人口迅速增长和农村人口急剧涌入城市，挤得60年代城市精英这群凡夫俗子们措手不及；还有人认为从富裕的阿拉伯海湾国家回来的埃及工人们观念变 得保守。同时，世界局势也对埃及宗教产生了影响：巴勒斯坦旷日持久地处在水深火热之中，西方势力入侵其他伊斯兰世界，这些似乎都警示着伊斯兰教正面临危 险，人们也就更加热烈地拥护着这一信仰。

Some say that Egypt’s revived religiosity reflects not a return to old ways but a move to more modern ones. If more Egyptians read the Koran, perhaps it is because more are literate. Bible-reading and religious study similarly swept Europe when literacy first spread. If more Egyptian women don the veil, it is for temporal reasons as much as religious ones. Unlike their grandmothers, they travel on public transport to work or school. Headscarves keep hair clean, declare seriousness and modesty to pestering men and are a cheap way to make oneself look presentable.

一些人认为埃及重新变得虔诚并不代表他们再次走上老路，而是朝着更现代的社会迈进了一步。有更多的埃及人读起了古兰经，或许是因为更多的人能够读书识字。 欧洲扫盲初见成果时，同样也兴起了一股阅读圣经和研究宗教之风。有更多的埃及妇女戴上面纱，虽然不能否认是有宗教原因，但也有很多的暂时性原因。与祖母们 不同，她们乘交通工具上班上学，因而头巾能保持头发整洁，能在那些纠缠不休的男子面前展示出严肃端庄的一面，不用花很多的钱，就能让自己看上去体体面面。

It is only natural that religiosity should extend to politics, particularly given Islamic traditions that, in the absence of a Muslim “church”, see defence of the faith as a duty of the state. The Muslim Brotherhood has promoted this notion since its founding in 1928. Under the severe repression of the Nasser years the movement splintered, fostering radical offshoots that helped seed the global jihadism of al-Qaeda. Such developments were responsible for the assassination of Nasser’s successor, Anwar Sadat, in 1981, and for later terrorist attacks against tourists.

一国的宗教性渗透到政治方面，再自然不过，尤其是考虑到伊斯兰教的传统，即在没有清真“教堂”的情况下，保卫宗教信仰就成了国家职责。穆斯林兄弟会 1928成立之后，更推动了这一概念。在纳赛尔执政期间，国情每况愈下，穆斯林兄弟会四分五裂，其分支态度激进，孕育了基地组织全球圣战的恶苗。类似的形 势导致了1981年纳赛尔继任总统安瓦尔萨达特遇刺，多起恐怖分子袭击游客事件的罪魁祸首也在此。

Brotherly influence

兄弟会之殇

These, mercifully, have grown much rarer in Egypt in recent years. Mass arrests in the 1990s put thousands of extremists in jail, chased others offshore and convinced most Egyptian jihadist leaders to renounce violence. The mainstream Brotherhood has long since done so, espousing a gradual Islamisation of society and political pluralism, albeit within a hazily defined Islamic framework. It has never come close to power in Egypt, but exerts subtle influence through social work and has been a strong force in trade unions.

幸好，近年来类似事件在埃及很少发生了。90年代的大范围逮捕把上千名极端分子送进了监狱，其他人被迫逃出国境，埃及大部分的圣战领袖也开始谴责暴力。长 期以来，兄弟会的中流砥柱坚持这样行事，支持社会的渐伊斯兰化和政治多元化，尽管其伊斯兰框架的定义并不精准。兄弟会在埃及的地位从未触及政权，但通过社 会工作对埃及产生了微妙的影响，也成了行业联盟的中坚力量。

The Egyptian state, ostensibly secular, pretends to be a bulwark against the Brotherhood’s ambitions. It earns fat revenues from alcohol taxes and hotel casinos. Yet in other ways the government outbids the Brotherhood in championing Sunni orthodoxy. President Sadat amended the constitution to enshrine Islamic sharia as the “principal source” of legislation, which leaves matters suitably vague. Police hound Shias, Ahmadis and other “deviant” Muslim sects. The central government vets the qualifications and pays the salaries of most of the preachers in the country’s 75,000 mosques. Egypt’s president appoints the head of al-Azhar, Cairo’s 1,000 year-old seat of Islamic learning, an institution that includes Egypt’s largest university, with 335,000 students, as well as a network of schools with nearly 2m more. By law, al-Azhar has the right to censor books that touch on religion. It recently launched Azhari TV, a satellite channel promoting centrist, moderate Islam in a bid to stop the encroachment of Saudi-inspired fundamentalism.

埃及政权表面上看十分稳固，对兄弟会的野心造成了严重阻碍。酒精税，旅馆赌场，给当局带来了巨额收益。在其他方面，当局的筹码也因支持逊尼正统派而高于兄 弟会。萨达特总统修订了宪法，拥护伊斯兰法为立法的主要依据，由此，法律问题变得模棱两可，但并不至于难以让人接受。警察时刻警惕着什叶派，阿赫迈底亚， 以及其他“不守规矩”的穆斯林派别。全国7万5千所清真寺的传教士需经过中央政府评定合格，并由中央政府发薪。埃及总统指定爱资哈尔长老，坐落在开罗城的 爱资哈尔有千年历史，是伊斯兰最古老的学府，其中包括数所埃及规模最大的学院，共有学生33万5千人，此外，附属中小学还有近2百万的学生。法律规定，爱 资哈尔有权利审查涉及宗教内容的出版物。近日，爱资哈尔开设了爱资哈尔卫星电视台，推动中间温和派的伊斯兰教发展，旨在防止沙特激起的原教旨主义扩散。

The state has often seemed to prefer tokenism to real equality for Coptic Christians, who serve at many levels of government but remain starkly under-represented in the security establishment. The police have proven peculiarly inept at stemming sporadic but recurrent bouts of sectarian strife. Typically, such episodes end with burned churches, mass arrests and a government-imposed “reconciliation” that leaves Muslim antagonists unpunished. Such incidents often have their roots in petty local squabbles, but their tendency to take nasty sectarian turns has left Copts feeling vulnerable, making them cling even more tightly to their church.

对科普特基督教徒，埃及政权常更倾向于采取象征主义措施，而非真正的平等。科普特基督教徒虽参与到政府诸多层面工作，在安全机构里却明显缺乏话语权。事实 证明，警察在处理时时爆发没完没了的派系斗争上出奇的无能。通常，类似小插曲的结局总是教堂被烧，众人被捕，政府发文调停，穆斯林主人公们继续逍遥。这些 事件的导火线大体都是些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，然而发展成为恶劣派系斗争的趋势使得科普特教徒们日渐感觉无助，只能愈发紧密的团结起来。

Some observers detect signs that the wave of religiosity which started in the 1970s may have crested. They note, for instance, that fashions in veils have switched from frumpy wimples in sombre shades to colourful headgear, often combined with make-up and tight jeans. Less plain to the eye is a shift in ideological fashions, away from activist and public kinds of Islamism to quieter and more private pursuits of faith. The symbols of commitment among today’s radical youth are no longer guns and beards but pious conduct and knowledge of scripture. The religious wave has certainly not passed and may still carry a lot in its wake. But in Egypt, at least, it no longer looks like a revolutionary force.

一些观察人士注意到，始于70年代的宗教浪潮或许已达顶峰。比如说，他们指出妇女戴的面纱已经发生了变化：过去，头巾颜色暗沉透明度低，如今，她们佩戴颜色鲜艳的头饰，通常会搭配妆容和紧身仔裤。更有目共睹的是意识习惯上发生的变化，不同于过去激进的，大张旗鼓的伊斯兰主义，现在埃及人对信仰的追求更为安 静自主。现在，能代表有干劲的年轻人奉献的不再是枪支，胡须，而是真诚的作为和对圣经的了解。宗教浪潮当然还远未结束，随后可能会发生更多事，不过，至少 在埃及，这已不再是一支革命力量了。
